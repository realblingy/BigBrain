# Extra Features

Our extra feature is the profile page for an admin account.

As an admin you have a profile page which you can navigate to on right of the nav bar. Here it will show you your unique admin ID, your name, the amount of games won and the total hours played. Clicking 'Edit Profile' will bring you to a page where you can reset your name and change your profile picture. We had to add new routes the the backend to allow this feature to work.
