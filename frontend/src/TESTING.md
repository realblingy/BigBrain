# Some Information About Testing

For our UI testing, we added an extra step of adding a question rather than testing with no questions. This is because in our software, we perform error handling and prevent sessions from being run if there are no questions. This is because if there are no questions, it makes no sense for an admin to start the quiz and there is also no way of getting meaningful player and quiz results.
